Every data has stories to tell â€“ stories that start as little as average and outliers to prediction and machine learning. I believe that these stories can only be read by passionate problem solver like myself. I am a performance-driven data scientist who have a pride in a job well done. I have a strong background in statistics and have programming experience in multiple language such as Python and R. I seek not only to learn new ways to solve problems, but also to learn from other experts in the team. I believe combination of these strength can help to produce tangible outcome in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
