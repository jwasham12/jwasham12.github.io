## **Introduction**
Buying a house can be very stressful especially when it comes down to the price of the house. Everyone expects a house for the right price, but how can you measure the value of the price without measuring every aspect of the house. It might be possible to calculate all of these things, but it can be very time consuming and tiring. This is where data science can be used to help to pick the right house for the right price. I obtained the housing dataset from Kaggle which include 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. With data analytics and machine learning concept, this dataset can help us to see which house features have the negative or positive effect of the house price and build an accurate model that can predict the sale price.

## **Importing the Data**

This is the portion of data I obtain from Kaggle using the code. The Ames housing data contained 2050 rows and 81 columns. There were 39 numeric columns which contained information such as the year of the house built, garage area and pool area. Rest of 42 columns were categorical columns which contained information such as neighborhood, house style, and garage quality. From the picture above, the first issue of the data was the missing value in columns such as alley. The data also needs to convert the categorical columns into numeric in order to use the features in the regression.

## **Missing Value**

The first issue with the data is the missing values. The graph above shows the of the number of missing value in each column. When we look deeper into the columns with missing values, we can see that those values are not actually missing, but just cannot be measured or not applicable to be measured. For example, over 2000 missing values in the pool quality column can be replaced with NA (not applicable) if the corresponding pool area column show value of zero. This means that there is no pool in the house, so measuring the pool quality is not applicable. After looking into all of the missing values columns, I decided to replace the missing value in numeric columns to zero and NA (not applicable) to categorical columns.

## **Data Cleaning**

Since we wanted to use regression to predict the sale price of the house, the categorical columns need to be changed to numbers. One of the ways to change the values into numbers is to identify ordinal data. Ordinal data is a categorical data type where there is a clear ordering of the values. For example, basement quality is ordinal data which each category can be represented with numbers: Excellent (5), Good (4), Typical (3), Fair (2), Poor (1) and None (0). There are 19 ordinal data columns and 2 binary data columns. Binary columns such as central air conditioning can be represented as yes (1) or no (0).

## **Sale Price (Target Variable)**

Analysis of the target variable (sale price) is a crucial step before building a model since any type of skewness will have a negative effect on the predictions. The graph above shows the distribution of the target variable where the shape of the distribution is skewed. The distribution is skewed to the left where median (green line) is less than the mean (red line). In order to fix this skewed distribution, log transformation should be applied to the target variable.

After the log transformation, we can see that the median (green line) shifted toward the mean (red line). This means that the distribution is now less skewed and closer to be normally distributed. Therefore, this transformation will reduce the negative effect on the predictions.
