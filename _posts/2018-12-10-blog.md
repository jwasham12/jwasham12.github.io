### **Introduction**

Buying a house can be very stressful especially when it comes down to the price of the house. Everyone expects a house for the right price, but how can you measure the value of the price without measuring every aspect of the house. It might be possible to calculate all of these things, but it can be very time consuming and tiring. This is where data science can be used to help to pick the right house for the right price. I obtained the housing dataset from Kaggle which include 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. We will use this dataset to see which house features have the negative or positive effect of the house price and build an accurate model that can predict the sale price.
