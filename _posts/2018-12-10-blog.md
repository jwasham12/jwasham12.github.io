### Introduction

Buying a house can be very stressful especially when it comes down to the price of the house. Everyone expects a house for the right price, but how can you measure the value of the price without measuring every aspect of the house. Every aspect meaning the square-foot of the basement to the neighborhood the house is in. It might be possible to calculate all of these things, but it can be very time consuming and tiring. This is where data science can be used to help to pick the right house for the right price. We can use data analysis and machine learning algorisms to predict the sale price given the features of the house.
